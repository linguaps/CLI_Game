My beloved wife was 
killed last week. She was 20 years old. When she was dead, the police couldn't find the wedding ring. If we could find the ring, we could find a really strong evidence which would enlighten her murder. 
Strangely, detectives are assuming that there is a connection between her age and the room numbers.
